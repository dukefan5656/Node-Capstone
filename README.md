The Lazy Traveler

LINK TO LIVE SITE : https://thawing-coast-32878.herokuapp.com/

This site was made so you can create and manage backpacking trips more easily. I was a traveler for many years myself and I understand the balance of planning and flexibility. A "leg" is a stay in a place plus a route to a destination. You'll be creating "legs" to add to a vacation.

Each leg tracks:

1. A running budget for total money and days (both of which you establish when you create your vacation but can be edited later)

2. Accomodations

Which location you're staying in

How long

An individual budget

What kind of accommodation you're staying

General contact info and notes


3. Transportation

Where you are going

How you are going to get there

An individual budget budget

General contact info and notes
