# The Lazy Traveler

This site was made so you can create and manage backpacking trips more easily. I was a traveler for many years myself and I understand the balance of planning and flexibility. A "leg" is a stay in a place plus a route to a destination. You'll be creating "legs" to add to a vacation.

### User Story

#### Registering / Logging In
As a user, you'll be able to register login information to access your account. If you already have an account, simply login.

#### Creating Your First Vacation

If this is your first time using the site, once you have been authorized, you will be re-directed to the initial vacation creation page to create your first vacation.
This form requires 
  1. The name of your vacation
  2. A total budget (in USD)
  3. Total length of the vacation (in days)
  4. A calandar selection for when you will be starting your vacation

#### Adding Legs
Once you have submitted the inital information for your vacation, you are re-directed to the main page for adding legs. To begin, you must first fill out the initial accommodation information. No particular information is required, as you can easily edit it later, as well as the trouble with knowing every particular down the line.

##### 2. Accomodation Form

Which location you're staying in (city)

How long

Accommodation Type (Hotel, Hostel, AirBnb)

A total cost for the accommodation

Accommodation website

General contact info and notes

Whether the accommodation has been booked yet or not

#### After Submitting Accommodation Form
Once the form has been submitted, a bar at the top of the page is displayed that shows this "leg". The budget box is also updated.
You then have 3 choices from here. 
  1. Add another accomodation (which inherently creates a new leg)
  2. Add "route" info which represents the transportation to the next destination and is the other component of a full leg.
  3. View your current trip profile with all legs and budget visible. 

#### 3. Transportation

  Where you are going

  How you are going to get there
